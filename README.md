# hello-world
Hello All,
I am excited to be here at github!  (CHANGING LINE 2) I have been hacking away at websites since 2000 as part of my job and played with them as a hobby in the late 90s.  Things have changed since then!

It is amazing how fast this works.  There are probably 1000s of files being edited on their servers as we speak.  What a great way to collaborate with others and change code and review and test on the fly!
